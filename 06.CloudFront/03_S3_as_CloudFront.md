# ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS CloudFront with S3 as Origin

Amazon CloudFront + S3 = üî• blazing-fast delivery for static content.

CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) that can pull content from various origins, and **Amazon S3 is the most common origin** for static files like HTML, CSS, JS, images, videos, etc.

---

## üéØ Why Use S3 as an Origin for CloudFront?

Here are the top benefits of using **Amazon S3 as an origin**:

### ‚úÖ 1. Lightning Fast Content Delivery
- CloudFront distributes S3 content across **edge locations** globally.
- Reduces **latency** by serving content closer to the user.

### ‚úÖ 2. Scalability Out-of-the-Box
- S3 can store and serve **millions of files** without needing to manage servers.
- Auto-scales to meet sudden spikes in demand.

### ‚úÖ 3. Secure Access via OAC (Origin Access Control)
- You can **block public access** to the S3 bucket and only allow CloudFront to fetch objects securely using **OAC**.

### ‚úÖ 4. Reduced Load on Origin
- CloudFront caches files at edge locations. This **reduces repeated requests** to S3 (your origin), saving cost and bandwidth.

### ‚úÖ 5. Cost Optimization
- S3 storage + CloudFront caching = lower data transfer cost compared to serving directly from origin every time.

### ‚úÖ 6. Support for Custom Domain + SSL
- Attach a custom domain like `cdn.yoursite.com`
- Use **HTTPS/SSL** easily with ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)

## ü™£ How S3 Works with CloudFront as an Origin

When you create a CloudFront distribution and select S3 as origin:

### üîó CloudFront Pulls Content
- It **fetches** objects from the S3 bucket **on demand**, when users request them.

### üß† Caching Mechanism
- Files are **cached** at edge locations.
- You control caching behavior using:
  - TTL (Time To Live)
  - Cache-Control headers
  - Invalidation rules

### üîê Securing Your S3 Origin (Very Important)
- **Never leave your bucket public** unless you love trouble.
- Use **Origin Access Control (OAC)**:
  - Create an OAC
  - Attach it to the distribution
  - Block all public access in the S3 bucket policy
  - Use a bucket policy to **only allow access from CloudFront via OAC**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "AWS:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudfront::your-account-id:distribution/your-distribution-id"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Steps (Console)

1. Create an **S3 bucket** and upload files.
2. **Block public access** to the bucket.
3. Create an **OAC (Origin Access Control)**.
4. Create a **CloudFront distribution**:
   - Choose **S3 bucket (recommended via OAC)** as origin
   - Set **Default root object** (e.g., `index.html`)
   - Enable **HTTPS only**
5. Attach **OAC** to distribution.
6. Update bucket policy to allow CloudFront access.
7. (Optional) Add **custom domain + SSL** via ACM.
8. ‚úÖ Done! Access your content securely and globally.

## üìå Summary

- Using **S3 as origin** with CloudFront is the most common and efficient way to deliver static content.
- Always **secure your bucket** using **OAC**, and block direct public access.
- Customize caching, TTLs, behaviors as needed.
- Delivers fast, scalable, and secure content across the globe.
