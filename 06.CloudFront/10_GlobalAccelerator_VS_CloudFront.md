| **Protocols Supported**    | TCP, UDP                                          | HTTP, HTTPS                                    |
| **Static IP Addresses**    | ✅ Yes (2 Anycast IPs)                            | ❌ No (Uses domain names)                      |
| **Content Caching**        | ❌ No                                             | ✅ Yes (Edge caching)                          |
| **Performance Optimization** | ✅ Global routing on AWS backbone                | ✅ Edge caching for lower latency              |
| **Routing Type**           | **Anycast** via AWS Edge Network                 | **HTTP-based CDN routing**                     |
| **Supported Origins**      | ALB, NLB, EC2, Elastic IP                        | S3, ALB, EC2, Custom Origins                   |
| **Health Checks**          | ✅ Built-in endpoint health monitoring            | ✅ For origin failover                         |
| **Use Case**               | Real-time applications, gaming, APIs             | Websites, video streaming, images, scripts     |
| **Pricing**                | Charged per accelerator + data transfer          | Charged by data transfer and requests          |

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### ✅ AWS Global Accelerator

- Designed for **dynamic content**
- Uses **Anycast IPs** to route user traffic to the closest AWS region
- Supports **failover**, **geo-routing**, and **low-latency** connections
- Works at **network layer (TCP/UDP)**, not just HTTP

### ✅ Amazon CloudFront

- A **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** service
- Caches content at **edge locations** to reduce load on origin
- Great for static & dynamic web content (HTML, CSS, JS, videos)
- Works at the **application layer (HTTP/HTTPS)**
