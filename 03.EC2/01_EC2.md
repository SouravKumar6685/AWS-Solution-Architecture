# ⚙️ Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

## 🧾 What is EC2?

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a **virtual server** in the cloud that allows you to:
- Launch and manage virtual machines (called instances)
- Run applications on-demand
- Choose the type of OS, CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity

> EC2 = Cloud-based Virtual Machine + Scalability + Full Control 🧠

---

## 🚀 EC2 Key Features

- 🌐 **Highly Scalable**: Easily scale up/down compute power.
- 🔧 **Customizable**: Choose your OS, storage, and hardware config.
- 💰 **Pay-as-you-go**: Charged based on compute time used.
- 🔁 **Elasticity**: Automatically handle traffic spikes.
- 📍 **Region & AZ-based Deployment**: Launch instances close to users.

---

## 🧩 EC2 Instance Components

- **AMI (Amazon Machine Image)**: Pre-configured OS + software bundle
- **Instance Type**: Defines hardware (CPU, memory, network)
- **Storage**: EBS (Elastic Block Store) or Instance Store
- **Key Pair**: Used for SSH login (public/private key)
- **Security Group**: Virtual firewall for inbound/outbound rules
- **Elastic IP**: Static public IP for your instance

> 🔽 **EC2 instance families** are categorized based on use case:

| Family      | Use Case                               |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **General Purpose** | Balanced compute, memory, networking (e.g. `t4g`, `m7g`) |
| **Compute Optimized** | High performance CPUs (e.g. `c7g`, `c6i`)             |
| **Memory Optimized** | Memory-intensive apps (e.g. `r6i`, `x2idn`)           |
| **Storage Optimized** | High IOPS & throughput (e.g. `i4i`, `d3`)             |
| **Accelerated Computing** | GPU-based tasks like ML/AI (e.g. `p4d`, `inf2`)       |
                

> ✅ You choose the **type based on performance and workload** requirements.

## 🔐 What is a Security Group?

A **Security Group (SG)** acts as a **virtual firewall** for your EC2 instance.

- It **controls inbound and outbound traffic**
- You **attach** it to your EC2 during launch (or modify later)
- By **default**, all **inbound traffic is blocked** and **outbound is allowed**

---

### 🔐 Security Group Key Points

- SGs are **stateful** – If you allow inbound, response traffic is automatically allowed.
- Rules are based on:
  - Protocol (`TCP`, `UDP`, etc.)
  - Port Range (`22` for SSH, `80` for HTTP)
  - Source IP / CIDR block
- You can **attach multiple EC2s to the same SG**

---

### 🧪 Example Rules for Web Server

| Type       | Protocol | Port Range | Source           | Description           |
|------------|----------|------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| SSH        | TCP      | 22         | Your IP only     | For secure access     |
| HTTP       | TCP      | 80         | 0.0.0.0/0        | Open for everyone     |
| HTTPS      | TCP      | 443        | 0.0.0.0/0        | Open for everyone     |

---

## ⚠️ Best Practices

- 🛡️ **Never expose port 22 to 0.0.0.0/0** – restrict it to your IP
- 🔑 Use **Key Pairs** for secure login (SSH)
- ✅ Use **Tags** to manage and identify EC2 instances
- 🚫 Avoid using root account to access EC2; use IAM roles
- 🔒 Use **Security Groups + NACLs** for enhanced network security
