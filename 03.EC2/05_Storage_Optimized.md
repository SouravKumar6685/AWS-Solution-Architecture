# 📦 Storage Optimized EC2 Instances

## 🧾 What are Storage Optimized Instances?

Storage Optimized EC2 instances are designed for **high, sequential read/write access to large datasets on local storage**. They offer **low-latency, high throughput** to handle storage-intensive workloads.

> 🗃️ Ideal for workloads where **disk performance and size matter more than compute or memory**.

---

## 🚀 Why Use Storage Optimized Instances?

✅ High IOPS (Input/Output operations per second)  
✅ Low latency disk access  
✅ Direct access to **NVMe SSD storage**  
✅ Perfect for apps with heavy **disk I/O usage**

---

## 🧪 Common Use Cases

- 🧾 NoSQL databases (Cassandra, MongoDB, etc.)
- 🧠 Distributed file systems (like Hadoop HDFS)
- 📈 Data warehousing and analytics
- 🛠️ Log processing & real-time indexing (e.g., Elasticsearch)
- 🎥 Media processing with high storage access needs
- 📤 Large-scale transactional systems

## 🧬 Popular Storage Optimized Instance Types

| Instance Type | Description                                   |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `i4i`, `i3`    | High IOPS for transactional NoSQL & OLTP      |
| `im4gn`       | Graviton-based – good performance per dollar   |
| `is4gen`      | Storage-intensive, Graviton-based              |
| `d3`, `d3en`  | High throughput for big data, HDFS, and NAS    |

> ✅ `i4i` is widely used for latency-sensitive NoSQL workloads.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- 🧮 High-speed **NVMe SSD** or HDD (depending on instance)
- ⚡ High throughput and low latency for storage I/O
- 💽 Up to **hundreds of thousands of IOPS**
- 🖥️ Optional **bare-metal** access in some types
- 📊 EBS optimization and Enhanced Networking support

## ✅ Do’s and ❌ Don’ts for Storage Optimized Instances

### ✅ Best Practices

- Ensure your app is **I/O bound**, not CPU/memory limited
- Use for **large-scale data ingestion and processing**
- Mount local NVMe drives properly (`/dev/nvme*`)
- Combine with **CloudWatch Logs** for monitoring I/O
- Use **RAID** for redundancy if needed (data isn't persistent by default)
- Backup important data – **local storage is ephemeral**

---

### ❌ What to Avoid

- ❌ Don’t use for memory or compute-heavy workloads
- ❌ Avoid storing important data without backup – local disks get wiped on instance stop/terminate
- ❌ Don’t use unless you truly need high IOPS – it’s more expensive
- ❌ Never ignore **disk utilization metrics**

| Feature              | Description                                        |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Focus                | High-speed, high-volume disk I/O                   |
| Instance Types       | `i4i`, `i3`, `d3`, `im4gn`, `is4gen`               |
| Best Use Cases       | NoSQL DBs, data warehouses, analytics, log storage |
| Not Ideal For        | Compute-heavy or memory-intensive workloads        |
| Optimization Tip     | Use **RAID 0** for performance, **RAID 1** for redundancy |
