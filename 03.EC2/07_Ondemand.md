# ⚡ EC2 On-Demand Instances

## 🧾 What is an On-Demand Instance?

An **On-Demand EC2 Instance** allows you to pay for compute capacity **by the hour or second**, **with no long-term commitments**.

> 💰 You pay only for what you use – no upfront cost, no subscription.

---

## 🚀 Why Use On-Demand Instances?

✅ Ideal for **short-term** or **unpredictable workloads**  
✅ Great for **testing, development, staging**  
✅ Zero commitment – launch and terminate anytime  
✅ Full flexibility with **no upfront payment**
