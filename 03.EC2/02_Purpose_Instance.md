# üí° General Purpose EC2 Instances

## üßæ What are General Purpose Instances?

General Purpose EC2 Instances offer a **balance of compute, memory, and networking resources**, making them ideal for a wide range of workloads.

> Think of them as "jack-of-all-trades" instances ‚Äì not too heavy on any single resource, but reliable for most use cases.

---

## üöÄ Why Use General Purpose Instances?

‚úÖ **Balanced Performance**  
‚úÖ **Cost-effective** for medium workloads  
‚úÖ **Flexible** ‚Äì handles varied applications decently well  
‚úÖ **Burstable or Sustained** performance based on the instance family

---

## üîç Where to Use General Purpose Instances?

General Purpose instances are suitable for:

- üßë‚Äçüíª Development & Testing environments
- üåê Web servers (Apache, Nginx, Node.js apps)
- üóÇÔ∏è Small to medium databases
- ‚öôÔ∏è Microservices-based applications
- üß™ Staging environments
- üì¶ Containerized workloads (Docker, ECS)

## üß¨ Common General Purpose Instance Types

| Instance Family | Description                              |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `t4g`, `t3`, `t3a` | üåÄ **Burstable instances** ‚Äì good for low-CPU workloads with occasional spikes |
| `m7g`, `m6i`, `m5` | üìà **Balanced compute/memory** ‚Äì good for consistent workloads |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Do‚Äôs and Don‚Äôts for General Purpose Instances

### ‚úÖ What You **Should Do**

- Use for **variable workloads** (e.g., APIs, dev/testing)
- Use **T-series (e.g. `t3`, `t4g`)** for **cost savings** on light tasks
- Monitor **CPU credits** if using burstable instances
- **Tag your instances** (e.g., `Environment: Dev`, `App: WebServer`)
- Use **Auto Scaling Groups** to handle load changes
- **Use IAM Roles** for secure access to AWS services
- Attach **Elastic IP** if you need a static public IP

---

### üö´ What You **Should Avoid**

- ‚ùå Don‚Äôt use for **high-performance computing** (use Compute Optimized instead)
- ‚ùå Avoid for **memory-heavy workloads** (like large databases)
- ‚ùå Don‚Äôt ignore **CPU credit balance** on burstable instances (`t3`, `t4g`)
- ‚ùå Avoid opening **SSH (port 22)** to the world (`0.0.0.0/0`)
- ‚ùå Don‚Äôt hardcode credentials ‚Äì use **IAM Roles** instead

---

## üí° Pro Tip

> Use `t4g` instances for **ARM-based cost savings** (Graviton2/3) ‚Äì they offer up to **40% better price-performance** for many workloads!

## üìù Summary

| Feature                 | Description                                      |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Use Case                | Balanced workloads                               |
| Instance Families       | `t4g`, `t3`, `m7g`, `m6i`, `m5`, etc.            |
| Ideal For               | Web servers, dev/test, microservices             |
| Avoid For               | High-performance computing or large DBs          |
| Best Practice           | Monitor resources, follow least privilege IAM    |
